    <h1 align="center">Kath&#233;</h1>
    <p>I am Kath&#233; (<span class="devanagari">काठे</span>) a tinkerer, an engineer, and a software programmer from Mumbai, India.</p>
    <p>Born in a Marathi speaking Indian Hindu family of the <em>Somavaunshiya Kshatriya Paathaare</em> clan of native Bombayites, I bear <em>Chitaapaavan Konkanastha Brahmin</em> lineage on my mother&rsquo;s side.</p>
    <p>Tinkering came naturally to me which my parents nurtured by gifting me <a href="https://www.meccano.com/" target="_blank">Meccano</a> sets instead of dumb toy planes and cars during my childhood. The exposure to building meaningful physical artefacts kindled a desire to study engieering and I went on to acquire an Engineering Diploma in Fabrication Technology from Fr Agnel&rsquo;s Polytechnic.</p>
    <p>My interest in software programming was the result of being exposed to the craft as a 15 year old while at St John&rsquo;s High School. The exhilarating experience of creating something tangible out of a bunch of abstractions far removed from physical limitations was so overwhelming that I went on to acquire a Professional Diploma in Network Centered Computing.</p>
    <p>I spent over 30 years programming computers for fun and as a means to earn my livelihood, beginning my career with Mumbai-based <a href="https://larsentoubro.com/" target="_blank">Larsen & Toubro Ltd</a>, followed by a string of start-up companies in Mumbai; Tisya (now defunct), <a href="https://www.pinstorm.com/" target="_blank">Pinstorm</a>, <a href="https://www.cleartrip.com/" target="_blank">Cleartrip</a> (acquired by <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>) and Ticketvala (acquired by <a href="https://www.makemytrip.com/" target="_blank">MakeMyTrip</a>).</p>
    <p>My first boss had difficulty pronouncing my first name and prefered instead to address me by my surname; Kathé, and that has stuck, hence the domain name.</p>
    <p>
    <p>You can contact me on <em class="unselectable">&#109;&#97;&#121;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#104;&#64;&#107;&#97;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#46;&#105;&#110;</em> and I'll write back at the earliest.</p>
