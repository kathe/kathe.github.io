## About

I am Kathé (काठे) a tinkerer, an engineer, and a software programmer from Mumbai, India.

Born in a Marathi speaking Indian Hindu family of the Somavaunshiya Kshatriya Paathaare clan of native Bombayites, I bear Chitaapaavan Konkanastha Brahmin lineage on my mother's side.

Tinkering came naturally to me which my parents nurtured by gifting me [Meccano](http://www.meccano.com/) sets instead of dumb toy planes and cars during my childhood. The exposure to building meaningful physical artefacts kindled a desire to study engieering and I went on to acquire an Engineering Diploma in Fabrication Technology from Fr Agnel's Polytechnic.

My interest in software programming was the result of being exposed to the craft as a 15 year old while at St John's High School. The exhilarating experience of creating something tangible out of a bunch of abstractions far removed from physical limitations was so overwhelming that I pursued and successfully completed a Professional Diploma in Network Centered Computing from the National Institute of Information Technology.

I spent over 30 years programming computers for fun and as a means to earn my livelihood, beginning my career with Mumbai-based [Larsen & Toubro Ltd](https://larsentoubro.com/), followed by a string of start-up companies in Mumbai; Tisya (now defunct), [Pinstorm](https://www.pinstorm.com/), [Cleartrip](https://www.cleartrip.com/) (acquired by [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/)) and Ticketvala (acquired by [MakeMyTrip](https://www.makemytrip.com/)).

My first boss had difficulty pronouncing my first name and prefered instead to address me by my surname; Kathé, and that has stuck, hence the account name.
