Robert Bringhurst's seminal (but print-centric) The Elements of Typographic Style advises 45–75 characters per line (cpl). The “average” English word is 5.1 characters long, so another way to measure it is 7–12 words per line (including spaces). Novice readers benefit from shorter lines of 35–60 cpl.
